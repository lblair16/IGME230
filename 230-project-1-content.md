##Story
You are the lone warrior, who's objective is to absorb all color in the universe. You always feel empty
and are searching for a way to fill the void that you are, and by absorbing the other colors 
you can gain a temporary feeling of fullness. The feeling just never seems to last, so you must continue 
to absorb as much color as possible, for all eternity. 

The main goal of this game is to survive as long as possible, while absorbing as many enemies as possible.
